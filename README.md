## Description

This is an Employee Directory application built with OOP practices. It queries and displays all employees stored in a MySQL database, as well as generate reports based on the information stored. It features a password-protected admin section with CRUD operations.

Database connection information is defined in /config/config.php. If this file does not exist or the connection information is not valid, the application will direct you to an installation prompt wherein you can fill out database credentials as well as create an initial log-in for yourself (admin). A sample SQL file is provided if you wish to simply plug and play with existing data.
