# Employee Directory PHP Application

## Demo

## Description

This is an Employee Directory application built with OOP practices. It queries and displays all employees stored in a MySQL database. It features a password-protected admin section with CRUD operations.

If you would like to plug this application into your own server, please remember to update the database connection information with your associated info. I have provided a sample SQL export file that you can import into your database, if you would like to work with some existing data!
