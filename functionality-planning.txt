Functionality doc: planning out functionality for app
---------------------------------------

Non-logged-in users will see a log-in prompt.

Users have 2 levels of access, employee and admin.

Employee users can view a list of all other employees but will not see any personal data.
They will only see names, phone numbers, email, job title, and picture.
Employees will be able to see and update their own personal data.

Admins can see all data, and have the ability to create new users as well as edit all employee data.
Admins can create other admins, employee-level users can only be created if there is an associated employee entry.
