Bugs and Things to Test for:
--------------------------------------

- separate code from html (separate db interactions from presentation logic)

- check input validating/sanitizing

- what happens if employee/user has the same name as someone else (duplicate records)

- email script for when you update your password (or any other alerts.)
    - alerts for admin?



--------------------------------------
TO-Do in the future:
- javascript heavy form validation?
- re-write in angular
