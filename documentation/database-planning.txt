** departments are created first
** when creating employee, select department from dropdown, select job title, input salary (which then creates a record in salary table)

** admins create departments and job titles in separate screen (admin dashboard)

** users can only be created if there's an associated employee entry. in real world examples, the first entry/user (super-admin?) would probably be generated by app company on initial software purchase. in this example, we'll just make some user accounts :D
