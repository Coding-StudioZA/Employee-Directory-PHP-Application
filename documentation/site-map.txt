Site structure/menu structure
---------------------------------------

Log Out
My Profile: update user info
    - update password
    - update email

Dashboard: homepage. mostly empty for employees, see data/reports for admin

My Info: user can see their associated employee info (employee info page)
    (eg: name, address, phone, job title, salary, department, etc)
    can change info directly on this page

Employees: list of employees,
    admins can click into each profile to see more info and edit
        - admins can view individualized reports here (?? maybe?)
    employees cannot click into profile?? (restrict access so that they cant just go to direct url)
    can search and sort table? (angularjs? maybe later down the road)



Reports: admin access only, can generate reports.
    maybe later down the road, add ability to export generated report to downloadable file

Admin: overall data/admin dashboard (should this be its own section?)
    - see employee salary history
    - see employee promotions
    - employment history

User Management:
    - see all users
    - add/delete

Admin Settings:
    maybe add ability to customize info seen on dashboard, and info seen first on reports?
        - would just be a separate screen with checkboxes or maybe a select? draggable boxes?
        - but would require a separate "admin_meta" table to save
