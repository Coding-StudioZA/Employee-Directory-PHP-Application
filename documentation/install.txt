Creating Config.php
-----------------------------------------

php form validation, no js required (although the site needs js for datatables.....)

list of mysql error codes: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/error-handling.html

on db class construct, check db connection.

Fail Cases:
- no config file exists (always check in header)
    then redirect to install

- empty database (db and login exists and works but db is empty)
    then create login (case 1)

- unknown database (1049), access denied for user (1045), or no host known (2002)
    then send to install db setup (case 0)
